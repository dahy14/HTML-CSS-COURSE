          Nature's first green is gold,<br />
          Her hardest hue to hold. <br />
          Her early <br />

        <h4>Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h4>
        <p>
          A trusting little leaf of green, <br />
          A bold audacious frost; <br />
          A rendezvous, <br />
          a kiss or two, And youth for ever lost.

          Some feelings are shallow, <br />
          some feelings are deep. <br />
          Some make us smile, some make us weep.<br />
          Some we love, some we don't.

          some feelings are deep. <br />
          Some make us smile, <br />
          some make us weep. Some we love, some we don't.

          They come in waves, <br />
          my feelings for you. <br />
          And not pretty whitecaps <br />
          dancing at my feet.
